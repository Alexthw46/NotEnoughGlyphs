# Too Many Glyphs!

An extension for [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau) with diverse sources of inspiration.
It features a great many glyphs. Quite possibly entirely too many of them.
Quite likely to keep expanding for quite some time.

Documentation integrated with Ars Nouveau's in-game guide book.

Started for the [Ars Nouveau 2021 Winter Addon-athon](https://github.com/baileyholl/Ars-Nouveau-Example-Addon).
