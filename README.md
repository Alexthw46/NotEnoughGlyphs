# Too Many Glyphs!

Additional glyphs for [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau) with diverse sources of inspiration.
Quite possibly entirely too many of them.
Quite likely to keep expanding for quite some time.

Documentation integrated with Ars Nouveau's in-game guide book.

## Fine Control glyphs

While not reaching the level of precision afforded by Psi, these may help get a spell to do what you want, or keep it
from doing what you don't want, get them going in the right direction, or even doing something context-sensitive.

## More to come ...
